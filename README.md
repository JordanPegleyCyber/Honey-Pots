# Honey Pots, nets & flies 

## Definitions
A honeypot is a security decoy in the form of a computer system that is set up to mimic a real target system (Oza et al., 2018, 6-9). It intends to attract cyber criminals and draw data on their attacks to gain essential defensive intelligence which will in turn be used to strengthen the real computer system. These honeypots are set up to be intentionally compromised to draw in attackers such as via a decoy billing system (Kaspersky, n.d.). 
A honeynet is a decoy network of several honeypot systems joined together to attract attackers similar to a honeypot (Oza et al., 2018, 6-9). As a larger network of honeypots, its greater attack surface allows for greater insight into an attacker's methods and techniques by capturing and recording all attacks against the honeynet (Oza et al., 2018, 6-9). 
Honeyflies are nuggets of data or files that contain particularly attractive sensitive information including but not limited to PII, Personally Identifiable Information. These honeyflies are placed within honeypots and honeynets to draw attackers in. 
Similarities between honeypots, honeynets and honeyfiles include the capturing of intelligence, allowing analysis of threat levels, vulnerabilities, system security and attacker behaviour to advance security defence (Kaspersky, n.d.). The difference lies between honeypots/honeynets and honeyfiles. Honeypots and nets similarly collect attacker data on a decoy system or network whereas honeyfiles are used as bait in singular enticing files such as a password file which may trigger an alert in the system for unauthorised access allowing the attacker to be traced and detected (Yuill et al., 2004, 116-122). 

## Advantages and Disadvantages
### Advantages
#### Threat detection
Honeynets expose vulnerabilities on the decoy attack surface which mimics the real-world system exposing newly emerging threats. They are also an excellent tool for exposing and gaining intelligence on trusted insider threat actors such as exploitation of vulnerabilities or permissions (Kaspersky, n.d.). 
#### Ease of Use 
Low interaction/resource light honeynet structures allow for simple reconnaissance gathering allowing intelligence to lead enhancement of security structures (Imperva, n.d.). Honeynets are also relatively simple in set up and hardware as there are downloadable honeynet/honeypot structures available online.  
#### Intelligence and Reconnaisance 
The prominent advantage of using honeynets is to gather intelligence on current behaviours and tools attackers are using. This keeps an entity updated and informed on attack surface threats. It provides defined data on intrusion activity as no legitimate traffic should be filtered through the honeynets only attackers (Kaspersky, n.d.) compared to noticing attack ip’s for example on a regular network. Honeynets can also be used as an excellent training and analysis tool for cybersecurity employees allowing refined threat detection in a safe environment (Kaspersky, n.d.)
These advantages provide the ability to strengthen cyber security defences and ensure the security of assets. 

### Disadvantages    
#### Threat Detection
Honeynets may give attackers access to a wider attack surface allowing expert hackers lateral movement and access to your network where there otherwise would be none (Imperva, n.d.).  
#### Ease of Use 
Honeynets and pots can be resource-heavy in high interaction honeynets that are more complex and provide extensive threat intelligence (Imperva, n.d.). Along with the cost of set up and management overhead for high interaction honeynets they may be unsuitable for entities with low resources.  
They also may be unsuitable for every organisation. Honeypots and nets are excellent in specific contexts for example a larger corporate network solution as a research and intelligence gathering tool in combination with other security walls or techniques (Imperva, n.d.). 
#### Intelligence and Reconnaisance 
As an excellent tool for gathering threat intelligence, a honeypot/net should never replace traditional security systems and audits (Kaspersky, n.d.). Organisations could become reliant on this tool structure and become blind to new threats. 
Conclusively the benefits of engaging honeypots & honeynets outweigh the disadvantages in terms of threat intelligence, analysis and enhanced security defense.
